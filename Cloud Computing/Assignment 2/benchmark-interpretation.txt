BENCHMARK RELAY


The results were expected for both of the scenarios because of the difference in the following factors:
•	Load on server was different on different days and time.
•	The network speed was also inconsistent.


VM List
The graph shows different trends on different days. On the January 13th the median execution time for each output of 10 iterations decreased on 
different timing of the day.  The median execution time for each output on the next day shows irregular variations. On the January 15th there was
 drastic increase in the execution time of each output. 
The last execution of the day showed the highest trend in the graph. 
The median execution time for each output on January 16th was almost the same. 

VM Boot
The output of all the recorded median execution time lies between 15 to 20 seconds. With the lowest record on the last execution of 14th of January
 and the highest execution time taken was on very next and the first execution of the day i.e. 15th of January. Every time of the day when these 
executions were performed, each output had its own median execution time which was different from one another.
